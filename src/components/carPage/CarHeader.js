              End of Year (2018) Update: Unfortunately 2018 wasn't the year I
              was hoping for with the car. I made a lot of really great but huge
              changes in my life, which meant automotively things took a back
              seat. At the second Autocross event of the year that I attended in
              May the clutch disk welded itself to the flywheel and rendered the
              transmission useless. It happened on the launch and ended with a
              great group of fellow racers pushing the car up on the trailer.
              Since every other part of my life was insanely busy that meant
              that the WRX didn't get back on the road till July, and after that
              I was a little gun shy so we just used the car as a cruiser for
              the rest of the year. But no sweat, things at home have calmed
              down and 2019 is looking like it will be another good year! New
              coilovers, new brakes, and a couple TLC items are all on the
              docket for the year which will put the car in its best place yet!
              Stay tuned! Here is my 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX TR. I have owned
              this car since July of 2010 and it is absolutely my baby. I
              pinched pennies to be able to afford it while I was in college. I
              modified it a little here and there throughout school, but it
              wasn't until after I graduated and started making money that it
              got to where it is today. It's entire suspension has been rebuilt
              from the ground up, down to the wheel bearings and dust shields.
              It has about every Whiteline, Kartboy, and Turn In Concepts
              suspension part you could want, joined by ST Suspensions coilovers
              (KW V1's without the fancy stainless body) and Group N tophats.
              Stoptech pads, rotors, and SS brake lines are also installed. The
              Enkei RPF1's help it stay light on its feet, I'm addicted to those
              wheels and have two sets, one with street tires and another with R
              compounds. The car has a built motor: sleeves, pistons, rods,
              valves, springs, etc etc etc. I run a Blouch 18g-xt with the
              factory sized intake and an 8cm turbine housing paired to an STi
              intercooler. I run 1000cc injectors, DW pump and FPR, with IAG
              rails. All told the car made 345 whp and 356 wtq. I have turned
              every bolt on this car myself and taken out, replaced, or repaired
              every system on the car at least once. I've spent a small fortune
              on this thing and it really boogies. Enjoy my hard work!
